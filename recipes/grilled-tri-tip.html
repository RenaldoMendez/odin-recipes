        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 pounds tr-tip roast</li><br>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled and very thinly sliced</li><br>
            <li>⅓ cup salt</li><br>
            <li>⅓ cup black pepper</li><br>
            <li>⅓ cup garlic salt or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a sharp knife, cut small slits in the top of the roast; 
                insert garlic slices into the slits.</li><br>
            <li>Mix salt, pepper, and garlic salt together in a small bowl; 
                rub all over the tri-tip and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day. 
                Remove tri-tip from the refrigerator about 20 minutes before grilling.</li><br>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li><br>
            <li>Place the meat directly above the flame to sear the meat and lock in the juices, 
                about 5 to 10 minutes per side.</li><br>
            <li>Turn the grill down to medium heat and continue to cook, turning occasionally, 
                for another 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center 
                should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for medium-rare. Let stand, covered loosely 
                with aluminum foil, for 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
